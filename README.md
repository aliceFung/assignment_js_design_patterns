###To Play:
- Enter an even number for the number of cards you'll be playing with.
- Pick two cards to flip them over. 
- If they match, you'll get points! If not, you lose a few points, but keep trying!

###In this (super easy) version, you:
- can still play even if you have negative points. Game never end until you match all the pairs! NEVER! :D
- refresh your page, if you want to play again.
- do not keep track of past games.
